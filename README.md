# One Month Rails - Pinteresting Project

This is a pinterest clone called [*Pinteresting*](https://bmg-pinteresting.herokuapp.com/) made using One Month Rails. The site is styled after the original pinterest but was implemented over the course of a couple days using a handful of different technologies and Ruby gems. The most noteworthy being:

  -  Ruby on Rails
  -  Heroku
  -  Amazon Web Services (S3)
  -  Paperclip (Image Uploads)
  -  Twitter's Bootstrap and SASS
  -  jQuery Masonry (flexible UI)
